## Key Features 

- **Go-based CVE Processor and Consumer Application with Kafka**  
The core of our system is built around a **Go-based CVE Processor** that downloads, extracts, and processes JSON files from **[CVEProject's Official GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**, and then pushes it to a Kafka topic.

    Next, we have a **Go-based CVE Consumer** that retrieves those messages from Kafka and stores them in a PostgreSQL database. Before storing in Postgres, we have Flyway migration scripts to automatically create the necessary schema, tables, and views in PostgreSQL.

    We maintain Dockerfiles for the Flyway migration scripts, the CVE processor, and the CVE consumer applications. These Docker images are integrated into custom Helm charts that are deployed to an EKS Cluster, provisioned through Terraform. The PostgreSQL database is deployed using Bitnami's Helm chart. 
    
    Whenever we push code to these repositories on GitHub, Jenkins builds and publishes multi-architecture Docker images (supporting both arm and amd architectures) to our private Docker Hub repositories.
    
- **CI/CD with Jenkins, Jenkins AMI with Packer**  
The **Jenkins AMI** is built using **Packer templates**, deployed via a **GitHub Actions Workflow**. Once the AMI is created, **Terraform** provisions the Jenkins server using this custom AMI.

    The Jenkins server is configured to host multiple **DSL jobs** that automatically scan for **Jenkinsfiles** across all our GitHub repositories. These Jenkinsfiles define our automated **CI/CD pipelines**, which include:

  - **Commit linting** to enforce consistent commit messages.
  - **Building and pushing multi-architecture Docker images** (supporting ARM and x86).
  - **Semantic versioning** for both **Helm charts** and **Docker image tags**, ensuring proper version management across deployments.

  This setup allows for fully automated and reliable CI/CD processes across our entire ecosystem.

- **Infrastructure with Terraform, Kubernetes, and Helm Charts**
Our infrastructure spans two AWS accounts within an AWS organization: the **Jenkins Infra Account** and the **EKS Infra Account**. Using **Terraform**, we provision all cloud resources, including the **EKS Cluster**, along with the supporting infrastructure. The cluster is bootstrapped with several Kubernetes namespaces dedicated to our microservices, and the deployment of applications is automated using **Terraformâ€™s Helm provider**.

    We manage deployments through **Helm charts** for the following components:
  - **CVE Processor**
  - **CVE Consumer**
  - **Postgres** (for persistent data storage)
  - **Custom Kubernetes Operator**
  - **Cluster Autoscaler**
  - **FluentBit** (for centralized logging)
  - **Grafana** (for visualization of metrics)
  - **Istio Base, Istiod and Istio Gateway** (for service mesh configuration and Istio Ingress Gateway)
  - **Kafka** (for message streaming)
  - **Kafka Exporter** (for monitoring Kafka metrics)
  - **Prometheus** (for metrics collection and monitoring)

  These Helm charts ensure that all applications and infrastructure components are deployed in a consistent, repeatable manner, streamlining management across environments.
